AS I GOT DEFINATION LIKE THIS :
<!-- Create a task manager application using PHP.
User can add the task with the selected date and time.
When user clicks the Add button, the task should be added to the list being displayed below the Add button.
If any task added which has current date, and the time is within the range of half an hour prior or later, compared to current time, then show a tick mark before that task.
The tasks should be displayed in the ascending order of date and time.
Each task should have a background color as follows:
If the task get completed - Green.  == past, k previous date na hoy te [currentdate karta previous date na]
If the task is currently active/running - Blue.
The next task in the list compared to current task - Yellow
Other tasks in the list - Orange -->
